A team of engineers making a multi-functional security camera using OpenCV and Python.

1) So if Vishal made a python script with OpenCV that can send a picture to your phone with pushbullet and then request closure of the system through text message confirmation
2) In that same way, we should be able to get a picture, and if it is a picture of pao we reply yes, and it sends more pictures depending on the accuracy of openCV?
